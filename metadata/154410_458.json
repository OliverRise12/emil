		"Test": " This is a screenshot of a photograph, which shows a small, rectangular object with a yellowish tint, placed on what appears to be a surface. The object looks like a small container or box, possibly used for carrying small items, and it has a shiny surface that suggests it may be made of metal or a similar reflective material. The image is taken from an angle where the object is not entirely in focus, but it is clear that it is resting on a surface, which could be a table or a counter. There is no text visible in the image. The background is indistinct and does not provide any context about the location or the purpose of the object. "
