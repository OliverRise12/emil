		"Test": " The image you've provided appears to be taken from a video with a low resolution. It shows a small, yellow object that looks like a brick or a piece of plastic, which is placed on a surface. The object has a rough texture and seems to have some sort of text or markings on it, but the resolution is too low to make out the details. In the background, there is a plain, dark surface, which might be a wall or a table. The image has a grainy quality, indicating that it may not have been shot with high-quality equipment or may be affected by camera shake or motion blur. "
